# Raspberry Pi Build Status & Next Steps

## Current Status: ‚è≥ Building (In Progress)

Your Raspberry Pi is currently building the Docker image. This is **normal and expected**.

### Build Timeline

Based on build logs, you're approximately **30-40% through the build**:

‚úÖ **Completed:**
- Base images downloaded (Python 3.9-slim, Node 18-alpine)
- Backend builder stage finished (~845s)

üîÑ **In Progress:**
- System packages installation (~1657s) - Installing borgbackup, borg, openssh, etc.
- Frontend npm packages (~1708s) - Installing React and dependencies

‚è≥ **Remaining:**
- Frontend build (npm run build)
- Final production stage assembly
- Application code copy

### Expected Total Time

| Raspberry Pi Model | Estimated Time |
|-------------------|----------------|
| Pi 3 | 35-45 minutes |
| Pi 4 (2GB) | 25-30 minutes |
| Pi 4 (4GB+) | 20-25 minutes |
| Pi 5 | 15-20 minutes |

## What's Happening Now

The longest stages are:
1. **npm install** (frontend) - Downloading and building React dependencies
2. **apt-get install** (system packages) - Installing borgbackup and tools
3. **pip install** (backend) - Installing Python packages

All of this is **normal** for ARM architecture on first build.

## What to Do Now

### Option 1: Let It Finish (Recommended)
Just wait. The build is progressing normally. Go get a coffee! ‚òï

### Option 2: Monitor Progress
On your Raspberry Pi, run:
```bash
cd ~/Projects/borg-ui
docker-compose logs -f
```

You should see:
- Package download progress
- Installation messages
- Build step completions

### Option 3: Cancel and Use Optimized Build (If Impatient)
If you want a faster build, you can cancel and use the optimized Dockerfile:

```bash
# Cancel current build
docker-compose down
docker system prune -a  # Clean up partial build

# Edit docker-compose.yml
nano docker-compose.yml

# Change line 3 from:
#   build: .
# To:
  build:
    context: .
    dockerfile: Dockerfile.pi-optimized

# Save and restart
docker-compose up -d --build
```

The optimized build should be ~50% faster (15-25 minutes vs 25-40 minutes).

## After Build Completes

Once you see:
```
‚úî Container borgmatic-web-ui  Started
```

### 1. Check Health
```bash
docker-compose ps
```

You should see:
```
NAME                   STATUS
borgmatic-web-ui       Up (healthy)
```

### 2. View Logs
```bash
docker-compose logs -f borgmatic-ui
```

Look for:
```
[INFO] Borgmatic found: /usr/bin/borgmatic
[INFO] Starting server on http://0.0.0.0:8000
```

### 3. Access the UI

**From Raspberry Pi itself:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/health/system
```

**From another device on your network:**
```bash
# Find your Pi's IP first
# On Pi: hostname -I

# Then from your Mac/laptop:
http://192.168.1.150:8000
```

### 4. Test Network Connectivity

This is the big test! With host networking on Linux, the container should be able to SSH to other devices:

```bash
# Enter the container
docker exec -it borgmatic-web-ui bash

# Test SSH to another device
ssh -o ConnectTimeout=5 karanhudia@192.168.1.XXX echo "SSH works!"

# Exit container
exit
```

If this works, **problem solved!** The issue was Docker Desktop/Colima VM isolation on macOS.

## Troubleshooting

### Build Fails
If the build fails:
```bash
# Check error logs
docker-compose logs

# Try cleaning and rebuilding
docker-compose down
docker system prune -a
docker-compose up -d --build
```

### Container Exits Immediately
```bash
# Check why it exited
docker-compose logs borgmatic-ui

# Common issues:
# - Missing directories: Fixed by volumes in docker-compose.yml
# - Permission errors: Check file ownership
```

### Can't Access UI
```bash
# Check if container is running
docker-compose ps

# Check if port is listening
sudo netstat -tlnp | grep 8000

# Check firewall
sudo ufw status
sudo ufw allow 8000
```

## Files Created for You

1. **Dockerfile.pi-optimized** - Faster build using system packages
2. **.dockerignore** - Excludes unnecessary files from build context
3. **INSTALL_RASPBERRY_PI.md** - Complete installation guide
4. **This file** - Build status and troubleshooting

## Next Steps After Success

Once the container is running and SSH works:

1. ‚úÖ Access UI at `http://pi-ip:8000`
2. ‚úÖ Login with admin/admin123
3. ‚úÖ Change default password
4. ‚úÖ Generate SSH key in UI
5. ‚úÖ Deploy SSH key to target machine (192.168.1.XXX)
6. ‚úÖ Test connection from UI
7. ‚úÖ Configure first backup job

## Questions?

If something goes wrong:
1. Check the logs: `docker-compose logs`
2. Check container status: `docker-compose ps`
3. Review INSTALL_RASPBERRY_PI.md for troubleshooting section
4. Let me know what error you're seeing

**Remember:** First build is slow. Subsequent restarts are instant! üöÄ
