## üîÑ Remaining Tasks

### Frontend Tasks

### 1. Configuration-First Workflow
**Priority: Low**
- Disable all features until valid config saved
- Configuration contains:
  - Source directories (what to backup)
  - Repository (where to backup)
  - Schedule (when to backup)
  - Retention rules
- Auto-generate Borgmatic YAML from UI settings
- Persist in `/data/config/` by default
- **Files**: Multiple - requires architectural changes

### 2. Fix UI Alignments and Overall Design
**Priority: Low**
- Consistent spacing across all pages
- Better mobile responsiveness
- Improved form layouts
- Better visual hierarchy
- Consistent typography
- Better error message display
- Loading states and transitions
